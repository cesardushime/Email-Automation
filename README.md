**Python Email Sending Script**

This script demonstrates how to send an email using Python's `smtplib` and `email` modules. It utilizes a secure connection with SSL for enhanced security.

**Requirements**

* Python 3 (tested with 3.x)
* `smtplib` module (included in standard library)
* `email` module (included in standard library)
* `ssl` module (included in standard library)

**Instructions**

1. **Install dependencies (if necessary):**

   You can usually skip this step if you're using a modern Python environment.

   ```bash
   pip install smtplib email
   ```

2. **Configuration**

   - Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual email credentials and recipient address.
     - **`email_sender`** (your Gmail address)
     - **`email_password`** (your Gmail app password - see instructions below)
     - **`email_receiver`** (recipient's email address)
   - Optionally, modify the email subject (`subject`) and body (`body`) as desired.

3. **Generating a Gmail App Password:**

   Since storing your actual Gmail password in plain text is insecure, it's recommended to create a dedicated app password for this script. Here's how:

   - Go to your Google Account security settings: [https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security)
   - Under "Signing in to Google," select "App passwords."
   - Choose "Select app" and "Other (Custom name)."
   - Enter a name for this script (e.g., "Python Email Script").
   - Click "Generate" and copy the app password. Replace the `email_password` placeholder with this copied password.

4. **Run the script:**

   Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `email_sender.py`) and execute it from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python email_sender.py
   ```

**Disclaimer**

- This script is provided for educational purposes only. Please use it responsibly and adhere to ethical email sending practices. 
- Be mindful of potential spam filters when sending automated emails.

**Additional Notes**

- The script utilizes `smtplib.SMTP_SSL` for a secure connection over port 465.
- The `email` module is used to construct the email message with headers (From, To, Subject) and body content.
- The script establishes a context using `ssl.create_default_context()` for secure communication.

**Happy coding!**
